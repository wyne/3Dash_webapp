# 3Dash -- Documentation

## Getting started

Once the add-on is installed and running, open it from the Home Assistant sidebar. The onboarding wizard will guide you through the initial setup:

1. Enter your Home Assistant URL and port (default: `8123`).
2. Provide a **long-lived access token** (create one in your HA profile under **Security > Long-lived access tokens**).
3. Set your location (latitude/longitude) for accurate sun positioning.
4. Upload a `.glb` 3D model of your home.

## Accessing without the HA sidebar

By default, 3Dash is only accessible through the Home Assistant ingress (sidebar). To access it directly from any browser on your network:

1. Go to **Settings > Add-ons > 3Dash > Configuration**.
2. Set the **Web interface** port to `8099` (or any available port).
3. Open `http://<your-ha-ip>:8099` in your browser.

## Configuration

All configuration happens in the browser -- no files to edit manually.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Home Assistant connection | Onboarding wizard or Settings |
| Location (for sun tracking) | Onboarding wizard or Settings |
| Theme, rendering, camera | Settings modal |
| Lights, displays, shadow walls, tubes | Config editor |

## SSL / HTTPS

When running behind HTTPS, the add-on automatically uses `wss://` for the WebSocket connection. If you use a self-signed certificate, your browser must trust it for the connection to work.

## Backup and restore

You can export your full configuration (lights, displays, settings, and 3D model) as a ZIP file from the settings panel. Use this to back up your setup or transfer it to another instance.
